These are solutions to EE782 programming assignments for the Autumn semester of 2023.
## Metric Learning & Generative AI
Implemented a Siamese Network using a metric learning scheme (Cosine Similarity; paired with Crossentropy) on labeled faces in the [wild (LFW) dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/). Trained a generative model for generating face images, using a GAN and enhanced the model to a conditional GAN, where the condition itself is a real face image of a particular individual. The CGAN generates another image of the same person using a Siamese Discriminator implemented in the first task.
## LSTM-based Stock Trading System
Set up an LSTM-based stock trading system for high-frequency trading and modified it  modify the model to use multiple stock prices and day of the week as inputs to predict a single stock using this [Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrkalbag/ee782)
